# Deployment Logs & Terminal Access - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Added comprehensive terminal access and log viewing capabilities for deployed containers, allowing users to debug, monitor, and interact with their running deployments in real-time.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Terminal Access
- **Command Execution**: Execute commands directly in deployment containers
- **Working Directory**: Commands run in the configured working directory
- **Real-time Output**: See command output and errors immediately
- **Command History**: Visual history of executed commands and their results
- **Interactive Interface**: Terminal-like UI with command prompt

### 2. Log Viewer
- **Static Logs**: View recent logs (last 200 lines by default)
- **Live Streaming**: Real-time log streaming using Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Auto-scroll**: Automatically scrolls to latest logs
- **Pause/Resume**: Pause auto-scrolling to review logs
- **Color Coding**: Errors in red, warnings in yellow
- **Refresh**: Manual refresh capability
- **Clear**: Clear logs from view

### 3. UI Integration
- Added Terminal and Logs buttons to running deployments
- Quick access icons in deployment cards
- Modal dialogs for both terminal and logs
- Consistent dark theme with emerald accents

## Architecture

### API Endpoints

#### Terminal API
**POST** `/api/deployments/:id/terminal`

Executes a command in the deployment container.

```typescript
Request:
{
  "command": "ls -la"
}

Response:
{
  "stdout": "file1.txt\nfile2.txt",
  "stderr": "",
  "exitCode": 0
}
```

#### Logs API (Enhanced)
**GET** `/api/deployments/:id/logs`

Query Parameters:
- `tail`: Number of lines to return (default: 100)
- `follow`: Enable streaming (true/false)

**Without streaming**: Returns JSON with logs
**With streaming**: Returns SSE stream of real-time logs

### Components

#### DeploymentTerminal (`/components/workspace/deployment-terminal.tsx`)
- Command input with Enter key support
- Output display with color coding
- Clear button to reset terminal
- Loading states during command execution
- Error handling and display

Features:
- Shows command being executed with `$` prefix
- Displays stdout in white
- Displays stderr in red
- Shows exit codes for failed commands
- Tip text for common commands

#### DeploymentLogs (`/components/workspace/deployment-logs.tsx`)
- Static log fetching
- Live streaming with SSE
- Pause/resume auto-scroll
- Refresh and clear controls
- Line count display
- Streaming indicator

Features:
- Error highlighting (red)
- Warning highlighting (yellow)
- Timestamp preservation
- Live streaming indicator with animation
- Manual refresh button
- Clear logs button

## User Workflows

### Using Terminal

1. Click Terminal icon on a running deployment
2. Terminal modal opens
3. Type command and press Enter (or click Run)
4. See output immediately
5. Execute multiple commands
6. Clear history when needed

Example commands:
- `ls` - List files
- `pwd` - Print working directory
- `cat package.json` - View file contents
- `env` - View environment variables
- `ps aux` - View running processes
- `df -h` - Check disk usage

### Viewing Logs

1. Click Logs icon on a running deployment
2. Logs viewer opens with recent logs
3. Click "Live Stream" for real-time logs
4. Pause auto-scroll to review logs
5. Click pause icon or scroll up manually
6. Use Clear to reset view
7. Refresh to get latest static logs

## Technical Implementation

### Terminal Execution
Uses Docker exec API to run commands in containers:

```typescript
const exec = await container.exec({
  Cmd: ["/bin/bash", "-c", command],
  AttachStdout: true,
  AttachStderr: true,
  WorkingDir: deployment.workingDir || "/workspace",
});
```

### Log Streaming
Uses Docker logs API with SSE for real-time streaming:

```typescript
const logStream = await container.logs({
  follow: true,
  stdout: true,
  stderr: true,
  tail: 50,
  timestamps: true,
});

// Stream logs via SSE
logStream.on("data", (chunk: Buffer) => {
  const data = chunk.slice(8).toString("utf-8");
  controller.enqueue(encoder.encode(`data: ${JSON.stringify({ log: data })}\n\n`));
});
```

### Docker Log Format Handling
Docker logs use an 8-byte header format:
- Byte 0: Stream type (1=stdout, 2=stderr)
- Bytes 1-3: Reserved
- Bytes 4-7: Payload size
- Bytes 8+: Actual log data

Both components correctly parse this format to extract clean log data.

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: All endpoints verify user session
2. **Authorization**: Verify deployment ownership before allowing access
3. **Container Verification**: Ensure deployment is running before exec/logs
4. **Command Safety**: Commands run in isolated container environment
5. **Working Directory**: Commands confined to deployment's working directory

## UI/UX Features

- ✅ Color-coded output (green for commands, red for errors)
- ✅ Loading indicator during execution
- ✅ Keyboard shortcut (Enter to execute)
- ✅ Clear button for fresh start
- ✅ Helpful tips for common commands
- ✅ Responsive layout with proper scrolling

### Logs Viewer
- ✅ Large, readable display area
- ✅ Live streaming toggle
- ✅ Pause/resume auto-scroll

## Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
- Single command execution (not persistent shell session)
- No command history navigation (up/down arrows)
- No tab completion
- No interactive programs (like `vim`, `nano`)
- SSE streaming (not true WebSocket bidirectional)

### Future Enhancements
- Full interactive shell with WebSocket
- Command history with arrow key navigation
- Tab completion for commands and file paths
- File upload/download capabilities
- Log filtering and search
- Log export (download as file)
- Multiple terminal tabs
- Terminal themes
- Command favorites/snippets
- Syntax highlighting for logs

## Example Usage

### Terminal Examples

**Check Application Status**:
```bash
$ ps aux
```

**View Environment Variables**:
```bash
$ env | grep NODE
```

**Check Disk Space**:
```bash
$ df -h
```

**View Package Info**:
```bash
$ cat package.json
```

**Test Network Connectivity**:
```bash
$ curl -I localhost:3000
```

### Logs Examples

1. **View Recent Errors**: Open logs viewer, search for red-highlighted lines
2. **Monitor Deployment**: Click "Live Stream" and watch application start
3. **Debug Issue**: Pause streaming, scroll to error, copy error message
4. **Check Performance**: Watch for warnings and performance metrics
